The project is a web application that utilizes machine learning models to predict diseases based on user input of symptoms. It offers a user-friendly interface where users can input their symptoms and receive predictions about potential diseases they might have.Key features include multiple pages describing the services offered, user registration, and database management to maintain user records. The application allows users to store and manage past prognosis reports, organized by timestamped data. Additionally, users can access information about the predicted diseases, the application also facilitates searching for nearby doctors specializing in the predicted diseases, regardless of the user's geographical location.
 
 Some key points and features of the described project:

  - Implemented machine learning models in Python and hosted them as an API endpoint using Flask.
  - Utilized the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for web application development.
  - Incorporated Material UI for designing a visually appealing user interface.
  - Created multiple pages to describe the services offered by the application.
  - Implemented user registration and database management for maintaining user records.
  - Users can input their symptoms and receive disease predictions based on machine learning models.
  - The application provides features to gain knowledge about the predicted diseases.
  - The application offers a user-friendly interface to search for nearby doctors specialized in the predicted diseases, regardless of the user's geographical location.
  - Disease predictions are obtained through the Flask API endpoint, providing real-time results.
  - The MERN stack ensures efficient handling of requests, data management, and dynamic UI updates.
  - Material UI enhances the visual appeal of the application with pre-designed components and styling options.
  - The application allows users to manage and access past prognosis reports organized by timestamped data.
